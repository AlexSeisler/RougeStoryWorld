# RougeStoryWorld - System Architecture

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

RougeStoryWorld was built as a **professional marketing landing page** for an independent audiobook creator.
Its role is to provide a **clean, conversion-oriented front-end** that:

* Showcases featured books with ratings, covers, and Amazon links
* Embeds YouTube promotional videos
* Provides an author biography with trust signals
* Highlights testimonials from readers
* Captures basic email interest (mocked, not production)
* Directs all purchases to Amazonâ€™s storefront

---

## ðŸ›  Core Architecture Overview

The system is a **static frontend application** deployed on Netlify with React + Vite.
All eCommerce and payments are **offloaded to Amazon**, meaning no backend integration was required.

### ðŸ”¹ Frontend (React + Vite)

* React 19 + Vite bundler
* `react-router-dom` for routing
* Pages:

  * `/` â†’ Landing page (Hero, Books, Video, About, Testimonials, Email, Footer)
  * `/collection` â†’ Full book collection
* Tailwind CSS for styling
* Framer Motion for subtle animations

### ðŸ”¹ Backend

There is **no custom backend**.

* Supabase integration was originally scaffolded but removed for production-readiness.
* Email collection now simulates a signup flow without storing data.

### ðŸ”¹ Hosting & Infrastructure

* **Hosting:** Netlify (CI/CD from GitHub)
* **Assets:** Stored under `public/` (logos, covers, profile images)
* **External Links:** Amazon Author Page + YouTube embeds
